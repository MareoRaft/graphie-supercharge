While spending a lot of time in graphie, I began writing reusable functions for myself in order to save time.  This set of functions continued to grow until a few months ago, when the functions just about covered every need I might encounter in graphie.  It would be a great timesaver to many question writers to have access to these functions, so I have written up a new version of the Graphie user guide that includes them.  This will prevent other question writers from having to re-invent the wheel, and will save everyone a lot of time.
